# The Complete React Native and Redux Course Review

  

Have you wanted to learn React Native for a while and been wondering what course or tutorial to take? Have you been doing JavaScript, React or React Native and want a good course to advance your skills? Generally are you looking for React Native tutorial and been wondering which one to take, confused about all the available online content? Well, you are in luck. Am going to take a short while and a few words to review [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

  

## Instructor

It would be wrong to review a Course without taking a look at the trainer. I mean lecturers don't just walk into class and start teaching. They at least introduce themselves.

  

This course is created/instructed by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/). Stephen is a pretty descent trainer with 17 courses and over 200,000 students on Udemy as per the writing of this review.

  

Stephen has courses on a wide variety of topics. To mention but a few; [Node JS](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-node-for-developers/), [Go](https://www.udemy.com/go-the-complete-developers-guide/), [Ethereum](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/) and many more on React, React Native and other topics.

## Audience for Course

How good do you need to be to take this course?

  

**Beginner**

  

As you will notice in my review on this course, it starts from the very basics of setting up a React Native development environment to initializing your first project and moves on to build on the knowledge acquired.

  

However, to comfortably go through this course you will need to know just enough JavaScript to understand whats going on. A little React would also go a long way too, but no React Native knowledge is required.

## Content Overview

  

Time to get to the important details.

  

To start as off let's take a look at the content of this course. Some like thinking of this part of the review as the _executive summary_.

  

This [Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course) is going to populate your brain with a lot of knowledge on React Native. Here are a few notable ones.

#### - Loads and loads of set up.

- React Native set up.

  

The course goes into a lot of detail on setting up your React Native development environment. You don't have to worry about your choice of Operating System as this part is covered for both OSX and Windows set up. A moment of silence for Linux die hards, _like me_. But since linux is Unix like, some of the OSX set up can help you out.

- ES Lint.

I haven't seen many courses that actually take students through ES Lint set up. It's a really vital development tool, almost every serious project you'll work will have a linter and it would help a lot to learn it from the beginning. To avoid Text Editors wars, this is also done in 3 popular editor (VS Code, Atom and Sublime).

  

#### - React

It most likely sounds funny reading a React Native course review and finding React as a notable part of it. In most parts React Native uses React to build mobile applications. So the importance of React can not be over emphasised. This course in numerous occasions dives deep into React, explaining important concepts like components, prop types, rendering etc.

  

#### - FlexBox.

Styling is one of the most important parts of mobile development. If you have used a poorly styled app you would know. FlexBox is the Swiss army knife for UI designs on mobile, especially for React Native. This in essence makes FlexBox a core part of development in React Native. With such importance any React Native course would not be complete without FlexBox.

  

This course opens the pandora box that is FlexBox and tries to explain how it works. In the duration of the course some of the popular properties of FlexBox will be looked into and how different values of the properties affect positioning of elements on mobile. Some of the properties looked at to great detail include; `flex`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems` and `flexDirection`.

FlexBox is however not limited to this, there are many more goodies in FlexBox some of which are used in this course whereas others you'll have to learn on the go.

  

#### - User input.

User Inputs are an integral part of applications. They are used to take in user data and process it to display expected output. With this in mind you understand the importance of User Input especially in mobile.

The biggest pitfall most people find themselves in is trying to build Mobile inputs like Web based inputs. This course handles that, taking you through how to build and style your inputs for mobile applications.

  

#### - FireBase.

[FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) is one of the most amazing platforms to use in your apps. If you haven't used it, you definitely need to try its awesomeness.

  

>FireBase is a platform for building iOS, Android, and web apps that provides automatic data synchronisation, authentication services, messaging, file storage, analytics, and more

  

Luckily in this course you'll get an opportunity to get started with FireBase. This course goes into step by step detail on how to get started with FireBase, Signing up, setting up a new FireBase project and most importantly Setting up FireBase for your project.

However, you will not get to go through all amazing features of FireBase, this course only . goes through Authentication using FireBase, for more you will have to **YOYO** (_You Own Your Own_) your Learning. Visit the [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) for more.

  

#### - Redux.

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) provides an easy way to centralize the state of your application. Redux is pretty important library especially when building front end applications. As your application grows there is need to have a robust state management which Redux does superbly.

You can read more about Redux in Stephen Grider's [response](http://qr.ae/TUT1e4) on [what is redux and who uses it?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Redux-and-who-uses-it)

  

The library is pretty confusing, but this course tries it to tackle it and simplify it as much as possible. As Stephen states in the course his aim is to:

> "Master the confusing terminologies and put plain English definitions to all different parts of the library."

>  _Stephen Grider_

  

This course has one of the best Redux explanations I have come across. Your Redux knowledge can literally get from "0 - 100 real quick" with this course. Well, Redux has quite a steep learning curve so maybe not 100. Stephen, however, takes time to dive deep into the working of reducers and actions separately, explaining in detail how each of them work and how they interact with each other to affect the store. Pretty cool and an excellently detailed explanation of the same.

  

#### - Navigation.

Navigation is a vital of mobile applications. Here is what the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html) have to say about navigation

  

>Mobile apps are rarely made up of a single screen. Managing the presentation of, and transition between, multiple screens is typically handled by what is known as a navigator.

  

With this explanation you realize the utmost importance of Navigation in React Native. This course takes on this topic head on, going through the importance of navigation and how to build one. Like the instructor says, this is one of those topics that explaining using words and diagrams doesn't work. You have to actually build things with it.

Navigation can be quite tricky thus the importance of having step by step guidance while building one.

There are several navigation libraries out there, this course uses [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) to implement the navigation. However, this library is currently not the best option, but that is something I'll talk about in the Critique part of this article.

  

## The Good

**Set Up**

Most courses tend to over look set up and hope the learners can do that on their own. Actually most of them just provide links to the set up documentation for various Platforms. This course however takes time to take users through the very important step of setting up and on different platforms to ensure the learner understands and gets started successfully irrespective of their platform of choice. Am sure Linux die hards will debate this.

  

**FlexBox**

The importance of FlexBox in mobile can't be emphasised enough. This course has taken its time to ensure learners get the best grasp possible on the concept and implement nice interfaces using the same.

  

**Redux**

As mentioned earlier this is one of the best explanation of Redux I have come across. The course takes time to simplify the terminologies of the library to plain english.

  

**Reusing Components**

This is a very important part of development using React. Using props to write components that can be re used which is something that is demonstrated in this course.

  

**Explaining**

Am pretty sure you have come across courses or online tutorials that just show some magic and totally give no explanation of what is going on. Well, this course is the complete opposite of those. To quote the instructor;

> "Am a big believer of understanding every last cut line of code that get written."

>  _Stephen Grider_

- Takes time to explain each library/dependency and why its being used.

- Explains every command you will run and what it supposed to do.

- The course also takes time to re write generated code to explain what the generated code does.

- Explains every bit of code you'll write.

- Dives deep into the working of JSX, using [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to explain it.

  
  
  

## Critique

**Navigation**

This course takes time to go through React Native Navigation and does it exceptionally well. However, the course doesn't use the currently recommended navigation library by react native. [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) is used to implement navigation in this course, it is a popular navigation library, but [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) is far more popular one than the others and is current recommended by [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html).

The use of this library is most likely because by the time of creation of the course [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) was the most popular option then and React Native didn't have a recommended one.

  

**Publishing**

It says its "The Complete React Native and Redux Course" but it misses one essential part of React Native. Publishing applications, this is sometimes one of the most challenging parts of developing applications, moving from development to production. It would have been lovely to have such a detailed explanation for Publishing in either Play Store or App Store.

## Conclusion
As I wind up on this review, here is my take on the Course. Stephen is a very good trainer that ensures that learners get to understand every bit of code. He takes his time to explain in detail important concepts for developing React Native applications like FlexBox, FireBase, React and Redux.
This is an amazing course for anyone that wants to get started with React Native or if you want to brush up on the topics covered in the course.
However, it's not "Complete", you will have to take time to check out other resources for Publishing and diving deeper into FireBase and FlexBox to be able to smoothly run from getting started to publishing your app on App Store or Play Store.

**Happy Learning👨🏾‍💻**
